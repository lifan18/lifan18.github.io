<h1 id="17-Reasons-Why-Less-is-More"><a href="#17-Reasons-Why-Less-is-More" class="headerlink" title="17 Reasons Why Less is More"></a>17 Reasons Why Less is More</h1><p><img src="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/img-4.jpg" alt="17 Reasons Why Less is More"></p>
<p>We live in a world that is driven by <strong>CONSUMERISM</strong>, where the message is always needing more and never having enough.</p>
<p>We are constantly bombarded with advertisements informing us that we need to eat more, shop more, and indulge more.</p>
<p>I moved to Spain 3 years ago, and whenever I return to the United States I’m almost shocked by the number of things people have.</p>
<p>This never shocked me in the past, it was my normal. I too was someone that had a lot of things.</p>
<p>Moving abroad let me realize that this type of consumerism is not healthy to the point that I almost felt SUFFOCATED by the number of things that are readily available to be consumed.</p>
<p>I found myself asking, do we really need to choose between 50 different types of cereals?</p>
<p>I’m lucky if I can find more than 5 types of cereals in supermarkets in Spain.</p>
<p>This is not to say that consumerism is non-existent in Spain, because it is a global phenomenon that affects every country.</p>
<p>Americans are known to live beyond their means, with some people having more debt than savings.</p>
<p>Minimalism Made Simple</p>
<p>We can blame it on insane school loans, medical bills, and celebrity culture but we also need to acknowledge that we are SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE for allowing our society to function this way.</p>
<p>In addition to social problems, consumerism is linked to increased anxiety and comparison, as well as contributes to destroying our environment.</p>
<p>The need to produce goods to keep up with demands- affects our forests, climate, and natural resources.</p>
<p>In a world of constant change, we buy things because we think it will <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.becomingminimalist.com/fooled/">make us feel secure and happy</a>.</p>
<h1 id="Less-is-More-Examples"><a href="#Less-is-More-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Less is More Examples"></a>Less is More Examples</h1><p>After our basic needs are met, *<strong>do <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/material-possessions/">material possessions</a> really bring us a real sense of security?*</strong></p>
<p>Have we stopped to consider that if we had less of something, that it could actually turn out to give us more?</p>
<p>More in the sense of joy, fulfillment, and happiness.</p>
<p>Not only applied to physical things but mental and emotional capacity as well.</p>
<h3 id="Let’s-take-a-look-at-some-ways-in-which-less-could-actually-mean-more"><a href="#Let’s-take-a-look-at-some-ways-in-which-less-could-actually-mean-more" class="headerlink" title="Let’s take a look at some ways in which less could actually mean more"></a><em><strong>Let’s take a look at some ways in which less could actually mean more</strong></em></h3><h3 id="1-Less-Stuff-x3D-More-Space"><a href="#1-Less-Stuff-x3D-More-Space" class="headerlink" title="1. Less Stuff &#x3D; More Space"></a>1. Less Stuff &#x3D; More Space</h3><p>Having less stuff creates more space.</p>
<p>The spaces we surround ourselves with can<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.stanforddaily.com/2018/09/24/the-importance-of-creating-space-for-yourself/"> impact our lives</a> more than we may realize.</p>
<p>It could greatly affect your mood and how you feel.</p>
<p>The art of decluttering and letting go of things that don’t serve us anymore allows us to have more space to enjoy- and the fewer things you have allows for that process to be easier.</p>
<h3 id="2-Less-Spending-x3D-More-Money"><a href="#2-Less-Spending-x3D-More-Money" class="headerlink" title="2. Less Spending &#x3D; More Money"></a>2. Less Spending &#x3D; More Money</h3><p>Do you ever go on an all-out shopping spree, just to feel guilty for spending so much money within hours?</p>
<p>The value of things loses its worth over time, but the feeling of guilt and debt is here to stay.</p>
<p>We tend to feel more positive when we are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/frugal-living-tips/">saving money</a> instead of spending it.</p>
<p>It leads to a real sense of security and preparation for future circumstances.</p>
<p>Before you receive your next flash sale email from a store you are subscribed to, simply unsubscribe and see how you feel.</p>
<h3 id="3-Less-Clothes-x3D-More-Closet-Space"><a href="#3-Less-Clothes-x3D-More-Closet-Space" class="headerlink" title="3. Less Clothes&#x3D; More Closet Space"></a>3. Less Clothes&#x3D; More Closet Space</h3><p>Correct me if I’m wrong but one of the most common arguments most couples have is over closet space.</p>
<p>I happen to be guilty as charged! Having less clothes allows for more closet space for you and your partner to share, and results in less arguments as well!</p>
<p>If you are unsure of how to downsize and figure out what you really need, you can learn more about building a capsule wardrobe <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/minimalist-capsule-wardrobe">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="4-Less-Furniture-x3D-More-Room"><a href="#4-Less-Furniture-x3D-More-Room" class="headerlink" title="4. Less Furniture&#x3D; More Room"></a>4. Less Furniture&#x3D; More Room</h3><p>When I traveled to Japan almost 2 years ago, I was AMAZED by how they know how to use space to its MAXIMUM.</p>
<p>In a city like Tokyo, which is home to over 10 million people- respect for space is deeply rooted within their culture.</p>
<p>When you have less furniture. you have less clutter. More room means a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thankyourbody.com/health-benefits-furniture-free-living/">clearer and calmer </a>mind.</p>
<h3 id="5-Less-Social-Media-x3D-More-Time-to-Read"><a href="#5-Less-Social-Media-x3D-More-Time-to-Read" class="headerlink" title="5. Less Social Media &#x3D; More Time to Read"></a>5. Less Social Media &#x3D; More Time to Read</h3><p>It’s easy to get caught up in the Digital World, but being <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/7-days-to-digital-minimalism-guide">consumed by information and social media</a> takes away from the positive aspects of technology and the benefits it provides us.</p>
<p>If you find yourself laying in bed at night scrolling through <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/take-a-break-from-social-media/">social media</a>feeds- consider downloading the kindle app or leaving a book by your nightstand to read instead.</p>
<h3 id="6-Less-Driving-x3D-More-Walking"><a href="#6-Less-Driving-x3D-More-Walking" class="headerlink" title="6. Less Driving &#x3D; More Walking"></a>6. Less Driving &#x3D; More Walking</h3><p>I know that we heavily depend on our cars to get us around, and sometimes we need them to get from one place to the other.</p>
<p>But if you find yourself within walking distance of some places, I encourage you to give it a try.</p>
<p>You can spend less money on gas, and exercise more. I love using my Fitbit to track my steps and heart rate. You can find the one I use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/3jYz3tp">HERE</a></p>
<h3 id="7-Less-Stress-x3D-More-Sleep"><a href="#7-Less-Stress-x3D-More-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="7. Less Stress &#x3D; More Sleep"></a>7. Less Stress &#x3D; More Sleep</h3><p>Stress is known to have negative effects on our overall health, and it’s no surprise that stress can disrupt our sleep patterns.</p>
<p>It’s good to take some time to pinpoint the stressors in your life and find a way to decrease that stress.</p>
<p>You will gain more sleep by worrying less.</p>
<h3 id="8-Less-Working-Hard-x3D-More-Working-Smart"><a href="#8-Less-Working-Hard-x3D-More-Working-Smart" class="headerlink" title="8. Less Working Hard &#x3D; More Working Smart"></a>8. Less Working Hard &#x3D; More Working Smart</h3><p>Have you ever felt that there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish all that you want to do?</p>
<p>When it comes to productivity we tend to focus on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.inc.com/john-rampton/work-smarter-not-harder-10-ways-to-be-more-effective-at-work.html"><strong>how long something</strong> </a>takes instead of what we actually accomplished.</p>
<p>Instead of always feeling that you are behind, try to automate some processes, create a routine, and measure your results in order to begin being more productive while you are working- instead of spending too much time working.</p>
<h3 id="9-Less-Planning-x3D-More-Doing"><a href="#9-Less-Planning-x3D-More-Doing" class="headerlink" title="9. Less Planning &#x3D; More Doing"></a>9. Less Planning &#x3D; More Doing</h3><p>While I think to-do lists are great for organization, sometimes we get so caught up with planning that we forget about doing.</p>
<p>I always say that if you try to do everything, you end up doing nothing.</p>
<h3 id="It-becomes-too-overwhelming-at-times-that-we-just-give-up"><a href="#It-becomes-too-overwhelming-at-times-that-we-just-give-up" class="headerlink" title="*It becomes too overwhelming at times that we just give up.*"></a>*<strong>It becomes too overwhelming at times that we just give up.*</strong></h3><p> Take some time to think about 3 things you actually want to do this week- whether that is going to the gym, writing a gratitude journal entry, or cooking a meal.</p>
<p>Spend less time planning so far ahead, and focus on things you can accomplish short-term.</p>
<p>This can provide the motivational boost you need to accomplish more. I like to do this by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/setting-intentions/">setting intentions</a>.</p>
<h3 id="10-Less-Junk-Food-x3D-More-Healthy-Food"><a href="#10-Less-Junk-Food-x3D-More-Healthy-Food" class="headerlink" title="10. Less Junk Food &#x3D; More Healthy Food"></a>10. Less Junk Food &#x3D; More Healthy Food</h3><p>Although this could be easier said than done, studies show that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/how-to-eat-less-junk-food-diet-health-advice-tips-study-a7529616.html">serving food to yourself</a> actually promotes you to eat healthier.</p>
<p>Preparing food from home will save you money and allow you to have more control over what you put in your body.</p>
<p>Try decluttering your kitchen and discarding the junk food items you tend to snack on when bored.</p>
<p>When you have better choices you make better choices.</p>
<h3 id="11-Less-Diets-x3D-More-Healthy-Living"><a href="#11-Less-Diets-x3D-More-Healthy-Living" class="headerlink" title="11. Less Diets &#x3D; More Healthy Living"></a>11. Less Diets &#x3D; More Healthy Living</h3><p>Trendy diets are full of false promises that send us the message that we can lose weight fast.</p>
<p>Although you may lose weight in the short term, it’s usual for people who restrict themselves to quickly re-gain the weight they’ve lost.</p>
<p>Instead of trying a new diet, simply focus on a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>This includes adding more fruit and vegetables to your diet, shopping for ingredients to prepare clean meals, and keeping the junk food out of the house.</p>
<p>When you focus less on dieting and more on healthy living you will see positive long-term results instead of a quick fix.</p>
<h3 id="12-Less-Digital-Files-x3D-More-Digital-Space"><a href="#12-Less-Digital-Files-x3D-More-Digital-Space" class="headerlink" title="12. Less Digital Files &#x3D; More Digital Space"></a>12. Less Digital Files &#x3D; More Digital Space</h3><p>In Cal Newport’s book “<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2lIZ5sM"><strong>Digital Minimalism</strong></a><strong>”</strong>, he teaches us how to consume less and fight our technology addiction.</p>
<p>Part of my personal journey to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.minimalismmadesimple.com/home/7-days-to-digital-minimalism-guide/">Digital Minimalism</a> included decluttering my computer and deleting files that were taking up too much storage space.</p>

<p>But I found over the years that I feel better when I drink less, and when I’m more intentional with the amount of alcohol I consume.</p>
<p>I started a 30-day personal challenge, that whenever I thought about having a glass of wine, I would pour myself a glass of water or ask for a glass of water if I was out.</p>
<p>I made it a habit to carry around a bottle of water so I would always have it available.</p>
<p>This simple change led me to drink more water over time, and less alcohol.</p>

Less Ungratefulness &#x3D; More Gratitude</h3><p>Take a little bit of time each morning or throughout the day to write down some things that you are grateful for.</p>
<p>Experts say that the act of keeping a gratitude journal and will help you to see the things in your life that are positive and to avoid focusing on the negative.</p>

Less Complaining &#x3D; More Encouraging</h3><p>Many things to complain about in life but complaining does not fix the problem. Instead, focus on things that you can fix and what you can change.</p>
<p>Sometimes feel like we need to control everything in life and when things don’t go our way we complain.</p>
<p>When we replace complaining and with encouragement, we start the process of positive reinforcement and accept the things that are not within our control.</p>

<p>Often, we feel like we need to share our stories or give advice and don’t really take into consideration that sometimes the other person just wants to be heard.</p>
<p> Next time you find yourself in this situation take a moment to simply engage by listening to the other person who will really appreciate the chance to share.</p>

<p>Less is more. We all know this saying, first popularized by minimalist architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which has been transformed into a platitude by advertisers, TV shows, and even corporate America as it right-sizes people out of their livelihoods (“We’ll have to learn to do more with less around here.”). But is less <em>really</em> more? And if so, is the opposite true? Is more actually less?</p>
<p>Questions like this may be more important than you think.</p>
<p>The two of us enjoy taking commonly accepted truisms and trite stock phrases and flipping them on their axes, exploring the obverse side of cliches and hackneyed phrases, shedding light on the opposite sides of supposed facts.</p>
<p>For example, what moniker does our culture often assign to a well-adjusted, ostensibly successful person? We often say that these people are anchored (“He is such an anchored person.”). We heard this term frequently during our late twenties: we were regularly described as anchored people, and for the longest time we took this as a compliment.</p>
<p>Then we stopped taking it at face value and asked, “What is an anchor?”</p>
<p>That question led us to an important discovery about our lives: an anchor is the thing that keeps a ship at bay, planted in the harbor, stuck in one place, unable to explore the freedom of the sea. Perhaps we were anchored—we knew we weren’t happy with our lives—and perhaps being anchored wasn’t necessarily a <em>good</em> thing.</p>
<p>In the course of time, we each identified our own personal anchors—circumstances keeping us from realizing real freedom—and found they were plentiful (Joshua catalogued 83 anchors; Ryan, 54). We discovered big anchors (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://theminimalists.com/freedom">debt</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://theminimalists.com/fake">bad relationships</a>, etc.) and small anchors (superfluous bills, material possessions, etc.) and in time we eliminated the vast majority of those anchors, one by one, documenting our experience in our first book, <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://amzn.to/1RkMeBn">Minimalism: Live a Meaningful Life</a></em>.</p>
<p>It turned out being anchored was a terrible thing: it kept us from leading the lives we wanted to lead. Not all our anchors were bad, but the vast majority prevented us from encountering lasting contentment.</p>
<p>Are you an anchored person? Is that a good thing? What are some of your anchors? And what other axioms might you want to question?</p>
<p>Which brings us back to our original set of questions: Is less really more? If so, is more actually less?</p>
<p>We suggest the answer to both is yes.</p>
<p>Owning less stuff, focusing on fewer tasks, and having less in the way has given us more time, more freedom, and more meaning in our lives. Working less allows us to contribute more, grow more, and pursue our passions much more.</p>
<p>Having more time causes less frustration and less stress, more freedom adds less anxiety and less worry, and more meaning in our lives allows us to focus far less on life’s excess in favor of what’s truly important.</p>
<p>So, more is less? Yes, more or less.</p>
